          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>4.1. The Company makes no warranty or representation that the Service can be accessed at all times. The Service may be temporarily unavailable or restricted for administrative or other reasons.

The Company does not accept any responsibility and will not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of negligence or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with any interruption, suspension or loss of use of the Service.</li>
            
            <li>4.2. You acknowledge that your uninterrupted access to and use of the Service may also be prevented by certain factors outside the reasonable control of the Company (a "Service Disruption Event") including, without limitation, the inoperation, inefficiency or unsuitability of the Equipment and the unavailability, inoperation or interruption of Internet or other telecommunication services. Non-performance by the Company of its obligations under these Terms will not be a breach of these Terms where such non-performance results directly or indirectly from a Service Disruption Event. The Company does not accept any responsibility and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with any such Service Disruption Event.</li>
            
            <li>4.3.

            <li>4.6. The content and any information available on or through the Website is for information purposes only. The Company does not hold itself out as providing any actuarial, accounting, consulting, investment, legal, tax or any other type of professional advice.

By accepting these Terms you acknowledge and accept that any financial information contained in any such pension modelling planner or other software tool is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as the basis of any decision to enter into any financial transaction and must not be used in place of professional financial advice.</li>
            
            <li>4.7. Whilst the Company will use its reasonable efforts to ensure that all transactions initiated by you via the Website are processed as soon as possible, it shall have no liability to you in the event of any loss being suffered due to processing delays which are beyond its control.</li>
            
            <li>4.8. Where the Website contain links to third party sites you should be aware that we may not control sites reached through those links and are not responsible for the content of sites which we do not control.

            <li>4.9. The Company will not be liable if and to the extent that any losses, damages, cost or expenses suffered by you are due to the provision of false, inaccurate, misleading or incomplete information or documentation by you or any third party or due to the acts or omissions of any person other than the Company or employees including without limitation the incorrect use of the Service by you or your failure to correctly input any data and/or information in connection with the Service.</li>
            
            <li>4.10. Except as expressly set out in these Terms, all other warranties and conditions, whether implied by statute, common law or otherwise (including but not limited to satisfactory quality and fitness for purpose), are hereby excluded to the extent permitted by law.</li>

          <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>5.1. The Company's aggregate liability to you whether in contract, tort, breach of statutory duty or otherwise for any losses whatsoever and howsoever caused arising from or in any way connected with the services from MSS shall not exceed £1,000,000 in the aggregate (including any claims for interest and costs).</li>
            
            <li>5.2. Where any damage or loss is suffered by you for which the Company would otherwise be jointly and severally liable with any third party or third parties, the extent to which such loss shall be recoverable by you from the Company, as opposed to the third party, shall be limited so as to be in proportion to the Company's contribution to the overall fault for such damage or loss, as agreed between all of the parties, or in the absence of agreement, as finally determined by an English court.</li>
            
            <li>5.3. Nothing in this clause 5 shall exclude or restrict any liability of the Company for personal injury, death, fraud or dishonesty or otherwise to the extent that it cannot do so by law.</li>

          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>The Company may terminate your right to use the Service by giving notice in writing (whether electronically by means of the Service or otherwise) which will be effective immediately upon being sent, but this will not affect transactions already initiated.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>Severability</h2>
          
          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>If one or more of the provisions of these terms of use are at any time found to be invalid by a court, tribunal or other forum of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise rendered unenforceable, that decision shall not invalidate or void the remainder of these terms of use. These terms of use shall be deemed amended by modifying or severing such provisions as necessary to render them valid, legal and enforceable while preserving their intent, or if that is not possible, by substituting another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable which materially gives effect to their intent. Any invalid or unenforceable provision or provisions shall be severable from these terms of use so that the validity or enforceability of their remaining provisions, or the validity of the provision(s) in question in any other jurisdiction, shall not be affected.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>All of the terms and conditions relating to the Services and/or use of MSS are contained in these Terms and any other instruction or direction for use supplied to you by the Company. No oral communications that you may have with the Company shall override, supersede, vary or in any way alter these Terms or any part thereof unless the Company confirms them to you in writing.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>Change of Terms of Use</h2>
          
          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>We may alter, adapt or otherwise change these terms of use from time to time. Your use of the Sites or any service(s) made available on or through them will constitute acceptance of those amended terms of use and you should review them before conducting future transactions or making any further use of these Sites.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>No Waiver</h2>
          <p>Failure or delay to enforce any right under these Terms will not be construed as an implied waiver of the same or of any other right in the future.</p>
          
          <h2>Governing Law</h2>
          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and you agree to submit any claim or dispute arising in relation to, out of, or in connection with this Site (and any use you make of it or the services and/or opportunities offered through it) to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>General</h2>
          <ol class="terms-list list-unstyled">
            <li>12.1. These terms of use shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a partnership, joint venture or contract of employment between us.</li>
